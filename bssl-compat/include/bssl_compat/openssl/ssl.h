//
// In DTLS, the caller must drive retransmissions. Whenever |SSL_get_error|
// signals |SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ|, use |DTLSv1_get_timeout| to determine the

//
// When False Start is enabled, |SSL_do_handshake| may succeed before the

#define SSL_MODE_CBC_RECORD_SPLITTING 0x00000100L

// SSL_MODE_NO_SESSION_CREATION will cause any attempts to create a session to
